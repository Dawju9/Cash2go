# Cash2go - A Lottery Scratch-off Management System

## Overview

Cash2go is an advanced software system designed to manage and analyze lottery scratch-offs. The project enables the creation, processing, management, and analysis of scratch-offs, including secure winner masking and natural language generation (NLG) for prize descriptions.

The system provides a comprehensive solution for lottery management, from generating and selling scratch-offs to analyzing and paying out winners.

## Key Features

* **Scratch-off Generation**
	+ Generates scratch-offs with masked prizes using NLG.
* **Scratch-off Management**
	+ Manages scratch-offs, including registration, tracking, and analysis.
* **QR Code Scanning**
	+ Scans and identifies scratch-offs using QR codes.
* **Winner Analysis and Payouts**
	+ Analyzes winner data and generates reports.
	+ Automates payouts to winners.

## Technical Overview

The project can be implemented as a web application or hybrid application with the following components:

* **Frontend**
	+ User interface for generating scratch-offs, scanning QR codes, and displaying results.
* **Backend**
	+ API server for managing scratch-offs, processing data, and generating reports.
* **Database**
	+ Relational or NoSQL database for storing scratch-off data and analytics.
* **NLG Module**
	+ Uses NLG techniques to generate prize descriptions.
* **QR Code Scanning Module**
	+ Uses a QR code scanning library to identify scratch-offs.

## Technologies

| Component | Technologies/Libraries |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Frontend  | React, Vue.js, or Vanilla JS + HTML5, CSS3 |
| QR Scanning| jsQR or html5-qrcode    |
| Backend   | Node.js + Express, Python Flask, or Django |
| Database  | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or other relational/NoSQL database |
| NLG       | Python: transformers, GPT-2, or custom models |
| Other     | QR Code generator (e.g. qrcode npm package) |

## Setup Instructions (Preliminary)

1. Configure the backend environment (install dependencies, set up database, etc.).
2. Start the API server.
3. Deploy the frontend and connect it to the backend.
4. Use the user interface to generate, scan, and analyze scratch-offs.

## Proposal for Execution

1. **Requirements Analysis and Architecture Design**
	* Define the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
	* Design the system architecture.
2. **Database and API Design**
	* Design the database schema for scratch-off data and analytics.
	* Implement the API server.
3. **Scratch-off Generation Module**
	* Implement the scratch-off generation module.
	* Integrate the NLG module for prize description generation.
4. **QR Code Scanning and User Interface Module**
	* Implement the QR code scanning module.
	* Implement the user interface for generating, scanning, and displaying results.
5. **Winner Analysis and Payouts Module**
	* Implement the winner analysis module.
	* Automate payouts to winners.
6. **Testing and Deployment**
	* Perform unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.
	* Prepare the production environment.
